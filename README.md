# 1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating "user stories" help with this?
> Interpreting user needs is an essential skill when developing a program. Clear communication from the user and a comprehensive understanding of the problem being described is crucial to developing technical solutions. User stories are a powerful tool in this process which can be used to define a concise and human-readable expression of said problem. This tool can enhance the value and purpose of a feature by focusing on "who" the user is, "what" they want to achieve or accomplish, and "why" they need a solution to this problem. User stories ensure the development efforts align with the end-users expectations of functionality and useability.
> Throughout this course, I have learned how to create user stories that helped prioritize features, break down complex requirements into manageable tasks, and maintain a user-centric approach throughout the development process.

 # 2. How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
